# ns-dense-matter
A repository containing code for analyzing dense matter properties of neutron stars, including a neutron star structure solving routine, EOS data processing/cleaning, and a Gaussian Process Regression based EoS generation routine. In addition, functions for diagnostics such as credible level quantile calculations and likelihood calculation and weighing can also be found within the "executables" directory.

Dependencies: LALSimulation, RePrimAnd, Temperance, Universality.
